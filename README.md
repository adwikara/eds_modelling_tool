# EDS Modelling Tool

## Overview
This is a project that I worked on in Boston University's Applied Electromagnetics Lab, where a self-cleaning solar panel system called the electro-dynamic screen (EDS), is currently being developed. This program is a tool to model the EDS's potential benefits in terms of energy output, Performance Ratio, economic gain, and water conservation. The model runs on several inputs that are meant to be derived from collected field data. The model uses irradiance data from NREL's NSRDB, therefore right now only coordinates in the United States are available for the modelling.
